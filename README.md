# VCDesign Origins

This repository is an archive of primary source materials from which  
VCDesign (VCD) and BOA were derived.

It contains observations, incidents, and fragments written **before**
the architecture was formalized.

These documents are **not specifications**, **not best practices**,  
and **not interpretations**.

They are preserved here in their original form, without revision or commentary.

---

## What this repository is

- A record of concrete situations
- A collection of observations and failures
- Physical evidence of why certain boundaries and constraints exist

This repository represents **origins**, not conclusions.

---

## What this repository is not

- It is not part of the VCDesign or BOA core definitions
- It does not explain or justify the current architecture
- It should not be read as guidance or instruction

Any architectural meaning must be derived elsewhere.

---

## Relationship to VCDesign Core

VCDesign Core and BOA are defined and maintained in separate repositories.

This repository does not explain those specifications.
It exists only as historical source material that predates them.

For the architectural definitions, see:
- vcdesign-core (specification)
- PHILOSOPHY.md (design rationale)

---

## Relationship to VCDesign / BOA

VCDesign and BOA are defined independently, in separate repositories.

This repository exists only as a **historical anchor**.

There is no backward reference from here to the core definitions.

## Editorial policy

- Documents are stored as Markdown
- Content is kept as close as possible to the original
- No retrospective annotations are added
- No attempt is made to unify tone, terminology, or conclusions

Discrepancies and contradictions are preserved intentionally.
