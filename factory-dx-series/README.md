# Factory DX Series (Archive)

This directory contains a series of texts written during practical work
in factory and industrial system contexts.

They were recorded as observations and reflections at the time,
prior to the formulation of VCDesign or BOA.

The documents are stored as-is.

No attempt has been made to revise, align, or reinterpret them.
